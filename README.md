# DesertColors

Since macOS 10.14 Mojave different **visual modes like [dark](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/visual-design/dark-mode/) and light** are available for the desktop. Native app developers can use **named system colors** to get the best fit for both [**semantic colors**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscolor/ui_element_colors) (like "window background", "secondary label") or [**plain colors**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscolor/standard_colors) (like "red", "green"). 

To adopt these [colors](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/visual-design/color/) for **web development** it is useful to get access to their **color values for use in CSS**. That's what DesertColor is providing.

But be aware, that [Dark Mode](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/visual-design/dark-mode/) in Mojave is not only about plain colors and that there is more like "Desktop Tinting" or "Translucency".
